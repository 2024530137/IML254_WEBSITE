<h1>My Reflection</h1>

<p align="justify">
   Completing this IML254 individual project has been both challenging and meaningful for me. 
   At the beginning, I only knew very basic HTML such as paragraphs, headings, and inserting 
   images. However, throughout this assignment, I learned many new things including how to 
   organise a website, link multiple pages together, create a table, insert external links, 
   and manage my files properly. Even though the website looks simple, every step taught me 
   something new about how webpages actually work behind the scenes.
</p>

<p align="justify">
   One of the main things I learned is the importance of website structure. At first, I was 
   confused when some images did not appear or when the links that I created were not 
   functioning. After trying and checking several times, I realised that small details like 
   file names, folder locations, and correct linking are very important. This made me more 
   careful and disciplined when organising my project files. I also learned how every page 
   must be connected through a navigation menu, and how each webpage should maintain a 
   consistent layout so users will not get lost.
</p>

<p align="justify">
   I also discovered that creating a website requires patience. There were moments when I 
   felt stuck, especially when the GitHub Pages part did not work as expected or when the 
   picture did not load even though I thought I had done everything correctly. But these 
   problems helped me understand how to troubleshoot and not give up easily. I learned to 
   re-check my steps, adjust my coding, and make sure every element was in the correct place. 
   Slowly, I became more confident in handling HTML coding, even if it was only the basic 
   level.
</p>

<p align="justify">
   Besides technical skills, this project taught me to reflect on myself while preparing the 
   content for the website. When I wrote about my background, education, involvement as a 
   student, and experience, I realised how much I have grown throughout my studies. It also 
   made me think about my strengths and the things I want to improve in the future. Writing 
   my reflection helped me understand that learning does not only happen in the classroom, 
   but also through hands-on assignments like this.
</p>

<p align="justify">
   Completing this website also showed me the importance of creativity and simplicity. Even 
   though I kept the website basic without heavy designs or complicated CSS, I learned how 
   a simple layout can still be effective as long as the content is clear and well-organised. 
   This assignment reminded me that sometimes the most important thing is understanding the 
   concept rather than making something overly fancy.
</p>

<p align="justify">
   Overall, I feel proud that I managed to complete this website on my own with guidance and 
   constant practice. It may not be perfect, but it represents my effort and progress in 
   learning something new. I hope that in the future I can explore more about web development 
   and improve my skills further. This assignment has definitely given me confidence to try 
   more technical tasks and taught me that with patience, anything can be learned step by step.
